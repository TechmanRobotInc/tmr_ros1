Demo: Ask item (HandCamera_Value, Delta)
'ask_item' service send 'Read' request command to controller.
'tm_driver' node receive the result and publish it to 'tm_driver/svr_response'.
('tm_driver' node must be running)

'ask_item' service request param.:
string id -> response 'id' is same as request 'id'
string item -> item_name you want to ask
float64 wait_time ->

If 'wait_time' == 0,
the service call is non-blocking, only send 'Read' request.
The response data is NULL,
but you can still get result from topic 'tm_driver/svr_response'.

If 'wait_time' > 0,
the service call is blocking with timeout 'wait_time' sec. until the result is received.
You can get result in response data.
